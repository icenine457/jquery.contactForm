jquery.contactForm
==================

A self-contained jQuery contact form plug-in, written in CoffeeScript.

Features:
  * Optionally uses [Tipsy](http://onehackoranother.com/projects/jquery/tipsy/) for validation messages (if already loaded)
  * Fully self-contained - just .contactForm() an element and all child elements will be created.
  * .destroy() method allows hooking for use by other plug-ins (like [fancyBox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/))
  * Produces nice JSON output, has many overrides for customizing text and classes

TODO:
------------------
  * Fix rendering bug with Android browser (have not tested other mobile browsers)
